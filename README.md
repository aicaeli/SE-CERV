# CERV (Community Emergency Reporting and Verification)

CERV is an app that utilizes a community-based alert system, empowering citizens to actively improve their communities by reporting issues, hazards, and emergencies in real time. Users can submit reports with photos, files, and GPS locations, which are then forwarded to the appropriate authorities for resolution. The system promotes transparency, enhances emergency response times, and strengthens collaboration between citizens and institutions, ultimately fostering safer and more resilient communities.
